# Sinatra At The Movies

## Your Mission

Fork this repository and finish building a very simple movie review application using MVC principles using the components already provided.

When you are done, the application should be able to perform all the CRUD operations on a movie.

### Tips

1. The controller.rb file will be your main Sinatra file. Be sure to check its contents and use the comments within as a guideline. To run your application:
  ```
  ruby controller.rb
  ```
2. The Ruby class located within the models folder will give you a good head start. Use it as a foundation and, if possible, try not to modify it at all. It should contain all the functionality neccessary to create the 7 RESTful routes.
